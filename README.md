Q&A-1
What do I do if the screen auto-lock activates when I try to use the app?
A-1
While the App has a feature that askes the iPhone to not auto-lock when it is in use, the iPhone may override this setting if the iPhone has been switched to other Apps or the App has been dormant.  If this happens, you can go into the iPhone Settings > Display & Brightness > Auto-lock and change it to "Never" (just remember to change it back when needed and to manually lock the display for safety reasons.)

Q@A-2
When changing the brightness in the App settings, why does the slider show a different level than what the iPhone is currently set for?
A-2
While the App has a feature to set the brightness, the iPhone can be changed to a different level than the last one selected in the App. To re-activate the App brightness level, change the slide slightly back and forth.

Q&A-3
Why are there three large squares rather than numbers showing on the screen?
A-3
If the display is showing three large squares, go to App 'Settings' and use the slider to reduce the size of the App Font.

Key points to understand about this App:

No data collection beyond app functionality:
The app does not collect any additional personal data from your device beyond what is strictly required to provide the speed and direction information within the app. 

Using internal iPhone sensors:
The app is specifically utilizing the iPhone's built-in GPS and motion sensors, which are considered a more privacy-focused approach as they do not rely on external location data collection. 

No data sharing:
The app does not share any of the collected data with third-parties for advertising or other purposes. Note: How to check app privacy on your iPhone: Go to Settings > Privacy & Security (This is where you can manage which apps have access to your location, contacts, photos, and other data > App Privacy Report: You can also access a detailed report showing how apps are using your data by going to Settings > Privacy & Security > App Privacy Report).
